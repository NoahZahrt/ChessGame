Contributions: I worked by myself so I completed each part
Compilation and running: Compile and run program through the Game file as that is where the game is run though.
Assumptions: The user enters the correct input with a space between each number and also doesn't try to move the opposing players color pieces.
Additional features: None
Known bugs: Not really a bug but its still possible to move opposing players pieces, would have to add a check to make sure a user is only moving their own pieces.
Outside sources used: None
